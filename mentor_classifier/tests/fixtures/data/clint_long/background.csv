I was born in Los Angeles, California. I was raised there most of my life and I graduated from high school there. A couple of years after graduating from high school, then I joined the United States Navy. I was an Electrician's Mate for eight years. I served on an aircraft carrier. We went on many deployments. A deployment is when you go to war, you fight. We fought in the Iraq war. I went on three deployments and it was a really great time in my life. I had a lot of fun. At the end of the eight years, I decided that the Navy wasn't quite a career for me. So, I got out of the Navy. I started using the education benefits that we received and I started going to the University of California at Berkeley. I was majoring in computer science and afterwards, I started getting my master's degree from the University of Southern California. I also had a job at the Institute for Creative Technologies. It's been a lot of fun, this whole time. Thanks to the Navy.",Background

When I was young, my parents divorced. My father, he was in the army. So I didn't see him that much. I lived with my mother for a long time. We moved from state to state. I lived in Washington for a while, I lived in Alabama for a while. Eventually, I moved back with my father instead of my mother, in California. So, I have actually seen a lot of America, thanks to their divorce. Eventually, I graduated from high school and after high school, me and my father we didn't really get along so I broke away from him and a couple of years afterwards I realized that I needed some kind of jobs help me with my finances, help me, you know find some kind of direction in life.

My parents were divorced, so that means that I spent sometime with my mother's family, sometime with my father's family, sometime with my father's mother and sometimes with my mother's mother. So, I bounced around from household to household when I was a youth. I didn't really form any strong bonds with anyone but I did get an opportunity to see most of the world so I spent a couple years with my grandmother in Alabama. So, I got to shoot a few guns there and got to climb mountains and do all of that country stuff that, you know, a lot of people come into the Navy with. I just also lived in Michigan and it's kind of an impoverished area, if you have been watching movies and things, you probably know about this but it's developed my character in a lot of ways. Eventually, I finally moved to California and I have to say, out of all the places that I've been, which is all over America, California is the right place to be.

But those are things that I think maybe turned me into wanting to help my society a little bit more. Those are negative things. These are things that kind of pushed me to want to make the world a better place because I saw them.

It was kind of like a sine wave. So, when I was in elementary school, I always took tests and they always said that I was like very very high achieving or something like that. I always scored really high on my IQs, so I got the impression that I was a really bright kid. In high school, it kind of dipped down. I was a little bit more independent. I stopped doing my homework. I stopped listening to teachers. I started hanging out with friends a lot more. So, my 4.0s and 3.8s started going down to you know, very very low. That's one of the reason that I didn't go to college right away. I think many people in the nuclear field like I'm in had a very similar story. I'd say more than half the people had that story. They were bright as kids but they kind of somehow lost their way, ended up going to community college and then going to the military or some other situation. So, going through the military actually helped me out a lot because it taught me a lot of self discipline, a lot of reasons to get motivated to study a lot.

For instance, my job is, I'm a Japanese teacher in Japan but also work for the University of Southern California Institute for Creative Technologies and I find little pieces of jobs here and there.

Another game that I made was made with the VIVE controller and where you shoot zombies. The current game that we're making is supposed to be really really popular.

After it got started, I remember that there was a little bit of fear that I had, you know, I didn't know how big this thing was going to be. I definitely didn't know that there was a war that was about to be started but I did realize that, that's when it finally hit me. Before, I thought, the military is a place that you go, you learn some kind of job, you have a nine to five job and you probably clean some things, you work out a little bit but after 9/11 happened, then I realized, ""You know what?"", there's a job that needs to be done and I'm probably going to be the one that's going to need to do this.

Everybody around me, my neighbors, everyone was black and then, you know, you go to school that's mixed but I got to see that. I grew up some of my time in Flint, Michigan which is a very urban place but it's on the poorer side. So, that glove part, you know, I know all about that. And when I joined the military, then my first school was in Charleston, South Carolina which is another down south place but I got to see, you know, it's little bit more mixed. Then I went up to New York, Albany which is nice green country and I got to visit 'The New York City', you know, very often so that was really cool for me, to visit such a famous place. Later on, I got stationed in San Diego and it's super hot, well, it's good temperature, it can be very hot as opposed to New York which was freezing cold and it's a very big city. You know, it's my style of, I'm not a country backwards boy, you know, like, climbing mountains and hunting. I am a city guy myself. So, I got to see San Diego which is, like, I'm from California originally so that's up my tree. And then, I finally got to visit Bremerton, Washington which is in the middle of Washington state and it's kind of country, you can own bigger houses there, you know, for much cheaper. So, it's much less expensive than California and I knew a lot of people who used to be Californians but then they, you know, changed over to Washington because the life is a lot easier. They liked having a five bedroom house with a big green yard for the kids to play in and nice and quiet neighborhoods, you know, so, a lot of people change.

The electronics store that I went to it was, it had like ten floors and one of the floors is like Best Buy in America. Best Buy is America's most most most, it has the most electronic stuff that America can provide and it's on one big you know humongus floor but Japan has eight of those guys like if you want a camera at Best Buy well here's a stand you know you can see below there's fifty cameras, oh cool. No no, you haven't seen cameras until you go to Japan where they have an entire section of a floor devoted to cameras. You want a laptop okay at the you know Best Buy has this there's the apple section there's like you know twenty, twenty laptops over there you know. Japan is the place so. As far as the food goes, I switch over. When I'm in America I love ice cream, when I'm in Japan it switches over to ramen.

The first one is computer science itself, which is everything that's associated with the laptop that's in front of you. That includes the theory that's behind it, the abstractions that are associated with thinking about the way that you know, computers should work. That involves the electronics that are behind it, you open up the computer and you can see the mother board, you can see the resistors, you can see the current that's traveling through it. So that's the hardware portion, that's the thing that's on the screen that deals with web design that deals with the way that the colors look, also graphics. That's how the light comes from the computer and hits your eyes. There's the user experience part which is when you have buttons all over the screen, and maybe this button shouldn't be like here, maybe people want it bigger or smaller, maybe they want it on the other side screen. Maybe they think that it's boring, but if you change it in a certain way so that it's more fun. So that's, all of that combined is computer science. But what most people think about when they think of computer science is actually the coding part. Coding is what happens when you have your laptop open, you open up a program and you start pushing buttons on your computer screen to write lines of code so that when you compile it, you press play, it does something for you. So for instance you can make a game, you compile the game and all of a sudden you can play the game. Or you can make, you can start coding and then when you press play, you have Microsoft Word based on the code that you wrote. So that's what most people think about when they think of computer science, they think of the program that's associated with it, but computer science is a very broad range.","STEM, Background"

So then I saw how much musicians make and it's very very low, and okay well I'm artist at least you know like maybe about drawing, I get my art history from my mom and I looked at their salaries and it was very low. So then I set shut that book and then I kind of gave up on looking at salaries for awhile. A question that I would have, a question that I wish I would asked someone, is what are the different salaries that people can make and how can I become more involved in getting those high paying, those high paying jobs.

I grew up in the fifth sixth and seventh grade and part of the eighth grade in Germany, and although I didn't really see the military part of it, I did see some of the things that like you could have outside of the work. So I saw the nice house that you could live in, I saw the cool car that he was driving, I saw many times you know people PTing, exercising outside, PT is physical training.

I did eight years in the navy as an active duty Electrician's Mate and I learned a lot about engineering, and I thought I was going to go to college to do electrical engineering. However, some of the classes that you learn with electrical engineering are computer science, and I went to a research internship. It wasn't an internship it was just research for UC Berkeley, and I thought I was going to do electrical engineering, but they had so many cool computer science topics and professors and little things around campus that really empowered me to kind of consider computer science as a career. So when I went back home, when I was done with the research and I went back home, I really focused on my computer science classes and I just realized, hey you know out of all the classes that I am learning, math, science, english, the computer science classes were some of the most fun, and I just thought you know, if I want to make my own business, if I was doing electrical engineering I'd have to go to radio shack, I'd have to buy resistors, I'd have to spend lots of money, I'd have to like spend lots of time. But with computer science, you have your own business right in front of you if you just open up your laptop. You can have a million dollar idea just opening your laptop and typing on some keys.

So at the time I was just graduated from high school, I was working at McDonalds, and you know various odd jobs, Swap Meet, a movie theater, used to sell knives, used to sell home alarm systems, I was bouncing all over the place. And I kept coming back to the thinking you know what, the military is a good way to start. I knew about their money for education, I knew about, after you do your tour you could have a really good professional career outside of the military you know. So these things were in the back of my mind. Unfortunately, I tried to join in high school and my eyesight is really bad, so they had disqualified me from joining. So I spent two years outside of high school trying to you know make my way through community college, make my way through various odd jobs, and it just wasn't for me.

I had, I listened to rock and pop you know, Prince, Michael Jackson. So I thought, you know I'm listening to these songs and it gives me this feeling in my heart, so maybe I'm a musician. As it turned out, my brother didn't want to go to piano lessons anymore, so my grandmother didn't want to just take me by myself you know.

Birmington was kind of more to the countryside, but you can have bigger houses and you can do hiking and skiing you know  but it got pretty cold and rainy. New York was close to New York City, but Albany is lots of green trees everywhere you know. The houses are really big, but nothing was around that area. There was no building more than like five stories high you know, that's Albany for you so it's a very quiet town.

I have a good friend he was a fellow nuclear electrician with me, we've been learning computer science together, we fought through our electrician trainings together, and he went off and did his own thing and just a conversation that we had you know like sitting around with some coffee or some beers, we talked about like well what do you want to be? Well I wanna be this. What do you want to be? For instance he actually taught me a lot about mortgages and stuff. I read this book that he presented its called Rich Dad Poor Dad by Robert Kiyosaki, and after reading that book then I kinda got ideas like okay rather than the cubicle thing I probably want to make my own business or something. I'd rather you know like have some kind of other income rather than a nine to five job. Or rather we would talk about his prior relationship and the fact that like his wife maybe didn't want to work so much. And we thought about like the income and outcome of his of a one working party system. You know like if one person doesn't work and the other person just takes care of the kids, then I guess you can't be as rich as you normally would be. So that had an effect on me, the person that I wanna meet in the future. Do I want like a housewife, which is fine you know. She could have a decent life making kids and you know making dinner and you know folding clothes. Or do I want a someone who's working, in which case like my clothes would suffer, my kids who suffer, my household chores would suffer you know.

But for some reason I feel like what I wanna do is, I want to own my own business one day, or I want to make some really outstanding computer science product.

If you get into computer science, all of your instructors are going to say, ""You can learn any language. It doesn't matter which one it is. They're all the same"", which is, you know, it's true in a sense. So, C# for me, has been the easiest language to learn. Yes, all computer science languages are very very similar but some are easier to learn than others and it's because I like that for purpose. I think everything, from cars to airplanes, everything that's been created has a curve where it should be easier, the later it is in its cycle. So, when computers first came around, everybody was working with vacuum tubes, you know, physical things. Then, it became assembly language, then it became machine language, then it became A, then B, then C, then C#, then Python and Java. So, the later languages I think are based on the ones before and they said, ""Hey, how can we make this easier?"" and it just got better and better and better. So, for me, C#, it sounds like someone's talking, it sounds like, by sound I mean, you look at the code and it says ""If Bob is"". Anyways, it's really easy to read once you're reading the code and earlier versions I think are not as user-friendly. So, C# is the language for me.","STEM, Background"

Hermann Hesse is an author from Germany who wrote a few books. He wrote Siddhartha, which is one of my favorite books. Demian, which is another. If you've ever heard of Steppenwolf, he's the one who created that, you know, the band called Steppenwolf was named after one of his books and I've read most of his works. It taught me, well, his works taught me that, number one, there are really some bright people out there who are masters at their craft and I kind of got faith in humanity because of him. Now, I'm a STEM person and he is as humanities as you can get but despite that, I like the way that he presented what was on his mind through paper, to me. That's kind of the way that I try to make my code. I try to think, ""Well someone's going to be looking at my code later. So I have to make it very very clear. Even though it's a complex thing that I'm writing, someone has to be able to, like, look at it without me talking to them physically and understand what it is that I'm trying to, that I'm trying to present."" So, yeah it's a big jump to go from literature to computer science, you know, thinking of it the same way but he developed me mentally, based on the logic that his characters, you know, went through, like, I've had, like, difficult times in my life and I saw that his characters, even though, well this is 60-70 years ago, his characters went through some of the same things that I am going through. So, it's kind of, like, watching a really good well-written movie when I read his books. He's pretty much the only novelist that I read.

He was my first computer science professor in community college. I had never really programmed before. Most people had, you know, programmed something when they were in high school but I'd never even coded anything in my life and I took two classes with them and just the way that he wrote things on the board, you know, boxes and squares, all professors do that, so obviously he was my first one so he did it for me too. But it really opened my eyes into how computer scientists think. Halfway through the class, I realized that, you know, when I am sitting behind the computer, typing so much, which is what I thought computer science was, I thought it was like ones and zeros, bits and numbers. Most of the time, he was writing and drawing things up on the board, up on the white screen and even right now, you know, when I'm when coding, most of what I do, a lot of what I do is with sheets of paper and drawing and pictures and stuff. So, he really, like, kind of opened my eyes to what a computer scientist does. A computer scientist doesn't type code on the computer screen. That's his tool but what he does is, he thinks logically about his product and that consists of visual representations and those are things that are interesting to me and Professor Wilkinson was the first person that, kind of, showed it to me.","Mentor, Background, Decisions,Positive"

I was, I guess freshman, sophomore in high school and he is somebody that found me at one of the buildings that I was that. I was speaking German with my brother and because I used to live in Germany, I could speak it, you know, like, a little bit and he was, you know, German origin. He went to German church and he's downstairs in the basement of this building, you know, kind of, tutoring other black kids and he was very interested and like, ""Hey, I hear the language of my family. What is this, you know, in this place?"" and he was like, ""Those two black kids over there are talking."" That really freaked him out. ""So, tell me about your story"" and we kind of told him about where we lived and about our mom and our dad and, you know, how we bounced around from place to place and spoke a little bit of German. So, he could understand that we're kind of bright. So, he said, ""Hey, you know, why don't you come over to my place? You know, come to our German church"" and, you know, like, and he introduced us around and that's how it started. So, his family was white, his mom and dad obviously really raised him to be, you know, a very respectable young man in the community. You know, he had his own house, he was 26. Three bedroom house and it was really nice and clean and you know, it's something that we really weren't used to, you know, back in my family. I guess I had my sister, she was ten years older than me, she was 26 as well, you know, she had a couple of kids and my mom, you know, she was divorced, so, like, it was all of us living in this one house and, you know it's like really cramped and it wasn't exactly dirty but it was very, in an impoverished area but he lived in Grand Blanc, Michigan which is a nicer part of, you know, Michigan and, you know, everyone has gone to college and the church, you know, everyone was like a community. It's very, two different aspects of life. So, that's the first person that I actually saw that really inspired me, really taught me the difference between what education is and what your life could be if you didn't have education.

I've had family that's taking care of me, I'm very thankful for that. All the way up until I was eighteen. After I turned eighteen, then I split from my father and I hadn't really seen too much of my family after that. So, I had to support myself, my own finances. Yeah, when I was eighteen, I had, like, forty dollars in my pocket and I think I was working part time at McDonald's and, you know, just a few bags of clothes at my feet and that's all I had in the world, you know. I guess everything I had was, you now, a couple of hundred dollars worth, maybe a hundred bucks worth, and that's it. So, I had to get from that to somehow getting a job with a good career that I could support myself and pay for my education eventually on my own and many people are like that. When you're eighteen, you know, you can get a job and you know, kind of support yourself but throughout this whole entire time, even when I wasn't in the military, I had to, you know, buy my own place, you know, support myself with my rent, with my food and without any skills, it was really difficult, I have to say. So, if you have a family that can support you during those times, that you can always go back to them if you lose your job, if you have to borrow the car, like little things like that, I didn't have. So, getting past that was a big step for me, it was a real challenge for me not having a family but eventually, I eventually joined the military and from that point on, everything was pretty much handed to you.

Obviously it's a great school and anybody would be really proud to go there but until that time, I felt, even though I was in the nuclear navy and you're allowed to have a really good job at the end, I knew that that job, being a nuclear-trained operator in the civilian world or even as a navy person, that wasn't for me, so it's kind of, like, I had to start fresh, and I did. After the military, I decided to be a computer scientist and I wasn't the best computer scientist around but I did have the good work ethic and it was obvious that I was trying really hard but I didn't really have a strong sense of my own confidence until Berkeley said that they were accepting me. That's when I knew, ""Hey, you know what? There are people that have been trying their whole entire lives to try to get into this school. There are people with 4.0s, with perfect SAT scores that are trying to get into this school"" and for them to accept me, that's kind of, validation for me. I know going to university isn't validation, any type of university isn't validation but it's something that I was trying really hard to do and I was successful at it.

So, I applied there as a 22-year old and I got rejected. I joined the nuclear navy in order to have a better chance to go to that school and I was doing really well, I was one of the top students in my class and I was really fit and in shape and I did everything the right way but when it came time to apply, I put that I wanted to do a humanities type job when really the Naval Academy expects you to have a technical job. So I said, ""I think I want to major in economics or something because they can learn languages"" and I didn't think it really mattered what you applied for. The only thing that matters is that you're an officer and then they will send you wherever. So, I thought maybe economics would be, like, a job that I could, like, kind of enjoy, and you know, I like the type of math that they do and, you know, it's kind of business oriented but really, they want electronics technicians and math people and computer science people, you know, more than economics, so. The XO called me and he's like, ""Well, you know, if you would have done that, then maybe we would have considered that."" So, it feels like, ever since that day, I should, like, I wanted to go back in time and kind of change what I put on my recommendation so that I could've actually went to this really high level school and it didn't work out that way. So, instead I was a nuclear technician for eight years and I learned lots of things.

So, to get to that point, it took a lot of watch standing, it took a lot of drills, it took a lot of marching around, it took a lot of reading books, it took a lot of opening up, you know, presentations and information sheets about my job, during times that I didn't have to. I think that's the difference between a lot of Chiefs who make it and some people who don't, what you do on your free time. If you really care about your career, then, during your free time, you're not just going to watch DVDs and watch movies and play cards and just go on drums. You're actually going to spend some time trying to be advanced to the next grade, to the next promotion level. As far as my civilian career, that's me being a master's student at the University of Southern California, it took a whole lot even more, even more than the military, it took a lot more dedication, homework, assignments, test preparation. On my free time, I would spend so much time just staying up all night, just doing these homework assignments. Even after the test was over, I'd still open the book and, kind of like, get those questions that I didn't understand on the test, I would get those questions again to review, to try to understand what it is, what the class was trying to explain. So, this is math questions, science questions, even English questions. I would present an English assignment and then I get it back and, you know, ""These are all the mistakes that you made."" So, I'd open up my Central Texas College, you know, handbook and I'd say, ""Oh, there should have be a quotation there, there should have been a semicolon there"", so, even simple things like that. And all of this is in order to become an expert at whatever it is I'm learning. So, as long as you make sure that you have that final goal in mind, which is to be an expert at whatever it is that you're doing, then you'll become a high level, you'll wind up at USC at a master's course or you'll be a Chief or higher in the military.","Background, JobSpecific"

When I started going to Berkeley, I just barely started computer science. So, I was a noob. I was just a very new person with computer science and during the orientation, there's is this guy that's, you know, kind of, explaining what the campus is like, what life is going to be like, what you can expect from the liberal campus and I was sitting in the computer science group and to my left and right were two of my newest friends. To my left, there was a Java programmer, he'd been programming for eight years, he was an expert in this field, he'd, you know, made several programs and, like, he explained all of this to me and I'm like, ""Okay, we're going to be going to the same class, alright"" and to my right, there was somebody very very similar. He was, like, accepted to Stanford and he went to Berkeley because it's cheaper but, he had been programming since he was twelve, when he made his first computer, you know, like, blah blah blah and I was like, ""Okay, so this is the average people going to my university and we're going to be taking the, all right, I got some work for me to do."" So, that was what was on my plate when I first started going. For the military, I would say that something similar was going, I felt was going to happen. I joined the nuclear technology side of the Electrician's mate course and I had never liked engineering things at all, at all. I was the opposite. I liked driving my car but if you told me to change my oil, I would say, ""I don't think so. I'm going to take it in to Midas."" I don't like grease, I didn't like screw drivers. The biggest accomplishment I'd done, as far as, like, mechanical type things was, I had put shingles on a house and yeah, I was outside and yeah, you know, the air smelled fine but those mechanical type jobs, I just didn't feel at that time was for me. So, that's one of the reasons I actually joined the nuclear side of the Electrician's Mate. It's because, I actually wanted to challenge myself in that. I wanted to, kind of, see what that side was like, so. But when I joined, I'm pretty sure everybody there had a big head start over me that I had to overcome.","Risk, Background"

The very first one that I did was when I was in community college. It was right before I was accepted to my university. It was at the Naval Training Center in Orlando, Florida. So, I was in the military before so that's probably a big reason why they accepted me for this internship but we were studying something, we were doing work on something called the MSAT. It's this big huge screen that Marines, kind of, like, sit in front of, with their guns, facing the screen and they're supposed to be talking to a helicopter and the helicopter is supposed to be dropping bombs on something. So, if they didn't have this screen, they'd actually have to do it in real life. They'd actually have to be on the desert and talk to a real helicopter to tell them to drop bombs on this place and the helicopter costs money, the people in the helicopter and the pilots cost money. Being out there in the field, you know, it all costs money but if you're doing virtually, then you save so much cash. So that's one of the first things that I was doing. The internship was to look at the code and help write the script so that when the person talks to the computer, that it understands what he says. So, if he says, ""Drop an illumination bomb on set XYZ in 300 yards. Explosion."" Maybe the computer might not exactly understand what he said. Maybe the computer hears, ''Alarmination instead of illumination"" and without that word, it wouldn't do the right thing. So, my goal was to say, ""Well, hey, sometimes people say illumination, sometimes people say illumination, sometimes people say illumination but no matter what they say, as long as they say il-la, then the computer should understand the rest of what he's trying to say because there's only one type of bomb."" So, that's, kind of, like, the first internship that I had. The next internship that I had was at the University of Southern California Institute for Creative Technologies where I was a quality assurance specialist. That's where I look at a game and I make sure that it's, all of the things are supposed to be working the right way, the sound works the right way, the colors work the right way, the listening of the computer works the right way and another internship that I had, it wasn't quite an internship but it was a job, as a Residential Computing Consultant for the University of California, Berkeley where I just go around, making sure that all the students had the right operating system, could get onto the wireless network and didn't have any viruses.","Background, JobSpecific, Skills, Growth/Learning"

For instance, I didn't really know what web design was, but when I started to learn what cascading style sheets were and how to put blocks on the screen and, you know, what a website was and how to read from a server, as I started to understand these things, like, ""Oh, you know, that seems kind of interesting. Maybe I'll be a web designer."" And then, you start to learn about, like, the operating system and I realize, like, what scheduling is, there's lots of stuff about operating systems and I decided, ""Oh hey, let's run away from that because it's not for me."" The more things I learned about computer science, the more focused I became in what it is I wanted to do. I always knew I liked to play games and after I started learning about what designers do, I finally focused in on that aspect of computer science, which is, I'm not the best programmer, there are programmers much better than me, I'm not the best artist, obviously, you know, those people with graphic design, you know, they do their own thing but what I did like to do is, kind of, go to a whiteboard, draw things out, kind of, explain what it is I wanted other people to do and myself included sometimes too and then have that be implemented. So, the more I did that, the more I said, ""You know what? Design is probably, it's been the funnest part of my job. It's the thing that has the least debugging, which, I hate debugging."" Debugging is when you have to, like, figure out the small little tiny portion wrong with your code, you know, and it could be, like, hidden in, you know, thousands and thousands of lines of code, you know, I hate those things. So, designers, they do the funnest part of the job without all of the negative benefits of finding small areas that could take such a long time.","Priorities, Background"

So I went to three different colleges. I went to Pasadena City College, that's in the Los Angeles area. I went to University of California, Berkeley it's up near San Francisco, and I went to USC, that's also near the Los Angeles area. One big thing was the landscape. All three of those places were absolutely beautiful, Berkeley is kind of up on a hill, USC has beautiful pristine buildings, and my community college, it looked like a university. It was right beside Caltech, California Institute of Technology and you can tell that they're right beside each other because I couldn't tell the difference that it was a community college so. The people around is another big thing that's very important. So I like diversity. All three of my universities you walk around and you know all different shapes, sizes, and colors. Right now where I'm at in Japan it's not so much. So you can kind of really tell the difference and for me I just like seeing people similar to me, and different than me, and smarter than me, and people that I could trash in math you know. So I like that whole entire spectrum of people. Also I think the biggest thing for me when I decided my university was the reputation. So I tried to go to the best that I could. In fact I wasn't accepted to Berkeley the first time that I applied, and I said you know what I came from Washington all the way back to California my hometown specifically to go to this university, so once I was rejected, I went back to my university, I studied even harder, I got a 4.0 that semester, I took on another job, I did research, I did all the things, I took extra classes, I did all of the things to make me a really more mature, more intelligent person to finally get into that university, because I realize that worldwide, wherever I mentioned that university people would automatically know the process that I had to go through the schooling that I got, and it would give me you know the jobs that I needed, and maybe the math and the science and engineering and the programming that I required to do my future things. So reputation was probably the biggest thing for me when I chose the college that I did.","Background, Decisions, Education"

At my undergrad UC Berkeley I was a resident computing consultant which is kind of a job to help students get their wifi and their computer set up. When I was in Japan I was part of that aikido club which meant that, it's kind of like martial arts where you people attack you and you put them on the ground a certain way.

They also look at your intelligence, how well you know it, if you're an expert or not. So I did waste a lot of time, I did play lots of video games, I did watch lots of Netflix, and maybe college isn't the right place to do that. You have the whole rest of your life to really enjoy things to the maximum, but college is the place to study, so of course I should relax a little bit, but I wish I would have really studied a little bit harder.

I really wanted to focus on my school, focus on my work. However when I looked at what was available I kind of saw that the jobs that you have in college are really really important for your success, for understanding what it is you're doing. When I was an undergrad I became a residential computing consultant which is someone that goes to the dormitories, looks at people's computers fixes their wifi. That experience was so great. It's one of the crowning glories of my Berkeley experience because I remember those things. I remember the people. I remember the coworkers that I had, and the parties that I went to, it was very, very good. Not only that, it paid a decent amount of salary that helped me get through my college years. When I became a graduate school, I also had the impression like no I'm gonna go to school, I'm going to focus on my classes and not worry about jobs. I had enough money to support myself. However a job showed up, the job that you're seeing right now that I'm doing, that really fit in to my major specifically. I study game development and a job came along that said well if you've been in the military, and if you are studing game development, and if you know computer science and if you're interested in game design, then we have a job for you. So that was, it was awe-inspiring that a job like that existed for me, and again in my graduate school that's one, it's one of the main things that I remember from my education. So having a job can be an integral part of your college experience if you choose the right one.","Background, Education, Challenges, Money"

That's what I always compared it to, normal nine to five job, you wake up nine o'clock to do the same thing, it's lots of work, there's lots of repetition, sometimes for my jobs until five o'clock and you go home pretty tired. College on the other hand, it's, number one it's very sporadic. On Mondays I have one class in the morning. On Tuesdays I have a class in the morning and then a night class in the evening. On Wednesdays I have three classes in a row but they're only one hour long and they're just all over the place and that's the first thing, that the schedule is different. The second thing is that each of those classes you know for a fact is going to be different. They're not gonna teach the same thing that they taught three weeks ago and then two weeks ago and then this week. You know you're on a different chapter, gonna be learning different things. If you're in chemistry you're gonna be working with different beakers. If you're in a robotics class you're gonna be working with robots this weekend and then the legs next week. Every single week is very, very different. The third thing is that it's challenging. So, in my nine to five jobs I'm either flipping burgers or I'm selling popcorn. Even with the harder jobs, you can be in a situation that it's very, very similar week to week, and because it's so similar, it's not very challenging. But with college, depending on how good you want to do, and of course I say if you wanna go to college you wanna ramp up your difficulty as much as possible, then you're gonna be challenged all the time. You're gonna have projects that you are gonna be working on overnight-you don't have that in a normal nine to five job. You're gonna be coming in on the weekends voluntarily-you don't have that with a normal nine to five job. You're gonna be working with different people and not knowing the answer and asking around and opening up books. You're actually gonna be going to the library for a purpose, not just to read Greek mythology. You don't have that in a nine to five job.

I'm learning some skills that you know I wouldn't have learned otherwise just by tutoring, just by talking one-on-one back in the States. Number two, I'm experiencing the food and the culture and the life and the language of Japan, and I needed that because, I guess, going to school all the time, studying computer science, you kinda get drained. So this is kinda like my break to experience someting new, something worldwide and Japan is really great for that. Number three, the payment here is pretty, pretty decent. It's not, you know, outstanding but as a student, you know, year after year after year USC is pretty expensive, so I actually came here and I've been saving up a little bit of money. It's going to help me, so I don't have to worry about that so much when I go back. Number four, I'm here because I really wanted to focus on, you know, give a lot more effort to my startup. I'm a part of a virtual reality startup that's trying to produce their first game. And if I'm in USC maybe I really have to focus on my studies, so I wanted to take a break so I can really get my hands dirty with my startup. And we're doing really well with it. So there's many reasons why I'm in Japan, but the best reason is probably because I love this place.","Background, Travel"

I love training people and I think the way that I can do that is probably by doing it online. By having my own business, putting everything that I want to say on Youtube or on some kind of video and handing it out to millions of people rather than just the four hundred people in my auditorium. So I think I want to take that extra challenge of becoming a worldwide professor, as in not being a university professor or college professor, but just training people in my own particular way.","Background, Education"
