I was born in Los Angeles, California. I was raised there most of my life and I graduated from high school there. A couple of years after graduating from high school, then I joined the United States Navy. I was an Electrician's Mate for eight years. I served on an aircraft carrier. We went on many deployments. A deployment is when you go to war, you fight. We fought in the Iraq war. I went on three deployments and it was a really great time in my life. I had a lot of fun. At the end of the eight years, I decided that the Navy wasn't quite a career for me. So, I got out of the Navy. I started using the education benefits that we received and I started going to the University of California at Berkeley. I was majoring in computer science and afterwards, I started getting my master's degree from the University of Southern California. I also had a job at the Institute for Creative Technologies. It's been a lot of fun, this whole time. Thanks to the Navy.",Background

When I was young, my parents divorced. My father, he was in the army. So I didn't see him that much. I lived with my mother for a long time. We moved from state to state. I lived in Washington for a while, I lived in Alabama for a while. Eventually, I moved back with my father instead of my mother, in California. So, I have actually seen a lot of America, thanks to their divorce. Eventually, I graduated from high school and after high school, me and my father we didn't really get along so I broke away from him and a couple of years afterwards I realized that I needed some kind of jobs help me with my finances, help me, you know find some kind of direction in life.

My parents were divorced, so that means that I spent sometime with my mother's family, sometime with my father's family, sometime with my father's mother and sometimes with my mother's mother. So, I bounced around from household to household when I was a youth. I didn't really form any strong bonds with anyone but I did get an opportunity to see most of the world so I spent a couple years with my grandmother in Alabama. So, I got to shoot a few guns there and got to climb mountains and do all of that country stuff that, you know, a lot of people come into the Navy with. I just also lived in Michigan and it's kind of an impoverished area, if you have been watching movies and things, you probably know about this but it's developed my character in a lot of ways. Eventually, I finally moved to California and I have to say, out of all the places that I've been, which is all over America, California is the right place to be.

I've seen lots of things that you see on movies. For instance, drug use, some violence here and there. I've seen more graphic things like prostitution, homeless shelter and things like that. But those are things that I think maybe turned me into wanting to help my society a little bit more. Those are negative things. These are things that kind of pushed me to want to make the world a better place because I saw them. So, even though Michigan was, the part that I grew up in, Flint, isn't the, you know, ideal city, it is a good place to grow up and develop your character.",Background

I had to ask him a few questions for the games I was making at USC and he was asking how to design a virtual reality program that he was making for me and we found out that we work pretty well together, you know, we both thought we were pretty smart, we both thought like, we work well together, we made each other laugh, so he said, ""Hey, why don't you join my start-up?"" So, I was there as a founding member and the games that we're making, we've made many in fact. One is that we used a Kinect to be combined with a Leap Motion controller and you can move around the play area in this kind of like virtual reality world, fighting dragons. Another game that I made was made with the VIVE controller and where you shoot zombies. The current game that we're making is supposed to be really really popular.

So, that's why I wanted to join the military, to go to their world famous language schools and learn to speak French, which I knew a little bit of, German, which I knew a little bit of, Spanish which I knew a little bit of and my English. Since then, I've also learned Japanese. So, the reason that I'm in Japan right now, is so that I can actually learn the language fully, because I didn't know that many languages up until now.

I grew up in Alabama and we used to shoot guns a lot too, and the fact that I was into that kind of a game and the fact that I used to shoot guys myself really got me into like, long distance kind of sports. So, I got my two expert, my marksman and my sharp shooter qualifications and because I'm really good with my eyes, you know, that got me into archery because it's a lot easier to do here rather than shooting guns.",Background

That was, maybe the first year that I was in, I hadn't seen a ship yet. I didn't know what the military life outside of school was like, but I remember walking down my steps to my roommate, when he saw, when we both saw together, the first, actually I saw the second plane hit, the first one had already been hit and my roommate called and he was like, ""Hey, look at this!"" After it got started, I remember that there was a little bit of fear that I had, you know, I didn't know how big this thing was going to be. I definitely didn't know that there was a war that was about to be started but I did realize that, that's when it finally hit me. Before, I thought, the military is a place that you go, you learn some kind of job, you have a nine to five job and you probably clean some things, you work out a little bit but after 9/11 happened, then I realized, ""You know what?"", there's a job that needs to be done and I'm probably going to be the one that's going to need to do this.

So I tried to do a little bit of piano when I was a kid. Me and my brother would go to piano lessons and I you know was a part of a black gospel choir. So I would always look at the guys that are sitting there you know dabbling on the piano really fast, and I thought you know what I can make songs like that. I had, I listened to rock and pop you know, Prince, Michael Jackson. So I thought, you know I'm listening to these songs and it gives me this feeling in my heart, so maybe I'm a musician. As it turned out, my brother didn't want to go to piano lessons anymore, so my grandmother didn't want to just take me by myself you know. So she cancelled our lessons and that was the end of that musical career. My mother was an artist, so I would always be like sketching on pads and stuff I would be drawing like animated characters X-Men and Spiderman and I was getting up there in my ability, but it also failed out.
