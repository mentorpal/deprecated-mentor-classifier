These questions are sorted by taking the cosine similarity of the verb in the sentence the entity was drawn 
from to the encoding of the answers to questions on the topic: "Background"

file name key:
f: when no verb can be parsed through the dependency parsing, the first verb is taken
i: entities where the subject of the sentence is "I" are given a base weight of 1
e: weight of cosine similarity of entity to blob added as well
p: pop culture terms downweighted

Rating considerations:
To facilitate testing for deduplication, repeat questions are given a 0 even if they are valid questions.
