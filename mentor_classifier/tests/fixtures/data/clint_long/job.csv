Most of the time you're working. I'd say about 75% of most days you're either going to work or coming from work or you know, sitting down preparing to go for work in a few hours. But, there is time to relax. So, many people, they join bands, they watch DVDs from the recreation center that we have there, they sit around and play cards, they kind of just sit and if it's later on at night, then you sleep, although like during the work day, you're not supposed to sleep at all. So, I remember my days would be, I would wake up at about 6:50, I would be in group, in formation at 7. It's only ten minutes I know, but you learn to be very very quick and then you're working until four o'clock. And from that point on, you could stand watch which would be another six hours after that, at least for me. Some people don't stand watch, some people do, its about half-half. Or you could be doing these trainings that come later on that night, they're called General Quarters. We were fighting a war, so they pretend like a bomb hit us or there's some kind of chemical spill or things that make you, that keep you on your feet to make sure that you have all the skills that you need to fight the casualty. So, short answer, you're working pretty much all day.","JobSpecific,Navy"
clintanderson_A26_1_1,Describe the work you do on a typical day.,What is a regular day like?|What is a typical day like in the Navy?|What do you do on a normal day?|What are you daily responsibilities?|Is the work the same every day?|Is every day the same?|tell me about your job in the navy.|what was your job like in the Navy?|What's your day-to-day?,"The work that I tend to do on a typical day actually depends on whether I'm deployed or not deployed. So, on deployment, then you pretty much are working the whole day and it's broken up into chunks. The first part of the day is just getting together, talking about how the rest of the day is going to be, do work orders. We write about the things that we should be doing for, maybe the next week or the next couple of hours or something like that. So the next chunk is we actually go and perform the work. So that's about another three or four hours. The next chunk is we get back and we start doing training, so we make sure that we're ready for casualties that happen, if there's a fire, if there's a flood. Then that's about the time that you get off work and you have a couple of hours just to kind of relax and hang out but later on at night, then you do this thing called General Quarters which means that you come back and the whole ship pretends like there is a big casualty happened to the entire ship. So your days can go into the night. When you are not deployed and you're stationed, you know, stateside, then your days are a lot easier. You have one part of, you know, training what we want to do later on. You have another part of training where you just open up a book and review some electronics or nuclear power things and then you have a small part where you are just doing preventive maintenance, which means that you're working on a pump, make sure that's fine, opening up regulators, making sure you know, nothing's inside and putting new equipment on the ship.","JobSpecific,Navy"
clintanderson_A29_1_1,How many hours do you work in a typical day?,What are your hours like?|What are your work hours?|How much do you work while in the Navy?|How many hours do you work?|What does an average day in the navy look like?,"The amount of hours that you work in a typical day actually depend on whether you're deployed or not. So, if you're deployed fighting the war, then I'd say 12 hours would probably be the average. On some days you get away with working only eight, that's including Saturdays. Many days, in fact every four days, you're working for a day and a half. So, you stand your eight hours of normal work and then you have your General Quarters, which is actually training at night time for two or three or four hours and then you could have another watch from midnight until six the next day and you could possibly have your normal work day tacked on the end of that. So, you know, some days, if you're really in it, you're working, you know, a day and a half to two. Sundays were my easiest days where I'd only work for six hours and that's like a great day for me. When you are not deployed, then days are a lot easier. You probably get to work around seven and then you leave around noon so that means your days are only five hours or six hours.","JobSpecific,Navy"
clintanderson_A54_1_2,What experiences do you have with nukes?,Have you dropped a nuke?|What have you learned about nuclear bombs?|Do you know how nuclear bombs work?|What do you know about nuclear technology?|What did you learn about nukes?,"When I joined, I had a couple of opportunities in front of me. I think I originally wanted to be a crypto tech but the nuclear field was very very exciting. They said that I had a good opportunity to go to the Naval Academy, they said that I'd learn physics and chemistry and thermodynamics and nuclear power, you know, very very well, they said that it's an advanced field and people out there in the civilian world know it. So, they gave all of these positives to join the nuclear field and I got to admit, that actually overshadowed any other job that I wanted to pursue. In A school, you learn, basically graduate level nuclear work, nuclear studies. So, I'd been in college and I went to master's courses and I got to admit, the military is actually more intense than college, than any college that I'd been to. They work you for eight hours per day, they give you lots of tests and it's simple, they always say that nuclear field is as hard as a pre-calc or I'm sorry, a pre-algebra class and that's actually true. Everything is written down for you in easy to read explanations and so if you could read normally as a high school student, for instance, if you got As and Bs and maybe even Cs in high school, then this learning is no problem for you. The difference is, you have to be willing to do it for a long time and if you start lacking, then you need to start doing all the homework that they tell you to do. They're not going to let you fail. The difference is, everybody that goes through this training, by the end, for the nuclear field at least, they know exactly what you're going to do, how to do the nuclear training that they've been shown and if you can't, then you have to do something else. So, there is no opportunity for failure.","JobSpecific,Navy"
clintanderson_A55_1_2,What is the role of nuclear technology in the Navy?,How is nuclear technology used in the Navy?|How is nuclear technology important to the Navy?|What makes nuclear technology important?|Why do you need nuclear technology in the Navy?|Did you work with nukes?|Have you seen a nuclear bomb?,"When I joined and they told me I was going to be in the nuclear field, I have to admit, until I started going to the school itself, I did not know what a nuke was. So, did I work with nukes? The answer is no. 'Nukes' mean nuclear weapons and if you work for a submarine, for a ballistic submarine, then you do see the nukes but you're not the one who is working on them. What the nuclear field means, is that we work for the engineering portion of the nuclear-powered aircraft carriers. So, we're the engine of the ship. If you think of a car as the aircraft carrier, then we're the things that make it, you know, go 'Boom!'. We're the thing that makes it go forth through the road I guess and we're the people that make electricity happen for the entire ship, we're the people that make the CD player run, basically we're the life blood of the aircraft carrier.","JobSpecific,Navy"
clintanderson_A59_1_2,How much of your time is spent with people versus with technology?,Do you spend all of your time with machines?|Do you stare at a screen all day?|Do you get to talk to people?|Is it boring working on only technology?,"Most of my time is spent with people, regardless of where you go. There's very few times that you're going to find yourself just being alone, just like I'm in port, they always have a buddy along to make sure that you don't get in trouble. When you're working, they actually have a buddy that goes with you to make sure that you follow the procedures the right way. So, you're always working with between two and five people for normal preventive maintenance that you do, and for each of those things, the only thing that we do is we work with machines. So, you're always with people and high tech equipment all the time.","JobSpecific,Navy"
clintanderson_A69_2_1,What experience do you have with nuclear bombs?,Do all people like you work on A-Bombs?|Do you often work on A-Bombs?|Are you afraid of atom bombs?|Did you work on nuclear bombs?|Have you seen nuclear bombs?|Does your position involve creating nuclear bombs?|Did you build nuclear bombs?|Did you build nukes?,"So, the nuclear question. What experience do I have with nuclear bombs? I don't have any idea what they are. I know kind of, what goes inside them because my job particularly deals with nuclear things but the nuclear technology that's used to power an aircraft to go through the water is very different from the nuclear reaction that goes on inside a nuclear bomb. Now that's not to say that some people don't. I was on an aircraft carrier, which means that there are no nukes on an aircraft carrier. However, other nuclear technicians, they go on submarines. Now, we have ballistic submarines, so they're walking right beside those nuclear bombs. We call them tridents or yeah yeah, I don't know anything about the submarine force, you have to ask them.","JobSpecific,Navy"
clintanderson_A70_2_1,How often have you been deployed?,When do you get deployed?|How many deployments do you go on?|Are you always deployed?|How many times do you go on deployment?|how long are deployments?|how long do deployments last?|how long are you on a ship for at a time?|have you been on a ship?,"I've been deployed three times. I joined the Navy when I was 21 years old, in 2000 and then I stayed there for eight years. So, the first two years were for school and then the last six years, that's the time I was on the aircraft carrier and during that time, I went out to the sea, deployment, for six months each, well, six months then seven months then eight months within two year sprints. So, in two years, you're supposed to go on one deployment, six months time. Then, you're supposed to come back for a year, I'm sorry, you're supposed to come back for a year and a half. So, six months deployment, one and a half years, you know, stationed at home, six months deployment, one and a half years stationed at home. So, because, I was in for six years, I did three deployments.","JobSpecific,Navy"
clintanderson_A78_2_1,How did your work day change over your career?,Compare you day now to when you started?|Is you work day different now?|Did you like the way your work day used to be?|How has your work day changed over a period of time?|Has your work day changed over the years?,"When I started my career, then I was an E3, which is the third rank that you can be in the hierarchy. Not a lot was expected of me. I get to work, they say, ""Go fix this pump"", ""Go work with that guy"" and then at the end of the work day, around like four or five o'clock, then, probably not much was really expected of me. They'd say, you know, ""Just go to your bed"" or ""We'll see you later"". It depends on whether you're on deployment or whether you're stationed at home but you might have to work, maybe one or two hours extra every other day. However, as I progressed, when I became an E6, which is a first class or a Chief which is an E7, then, after that normal work day of telling people what to do, you know, you're there the same exact time as they are, you have to do, like, the follow up at the end. So, for instance, they get done at the end of the day. So, now that you have that information, while they get to go home or they get to, like, you know, have that downtime, you have to go report that to other people. You have to do the paperwork that other people are requiring. So, you have to wait till the normal work is done and then you have to add on the supervisory specialization that you have to give at the very very end. So, you work more as you get higher in the rank.","JobSpecific,Navy"
clintanderson_A79_2_1,How has your view of this line of work changed over time?,"Have you changed your opinion about this line of work and if so, how?|Has your opinion of your job altered?|What about your attitude change concerning your profession?|Has your view of this work changed and how?","My view's changed for the military and a couple of ways. The first way is, that I understand the different roles of the military now. Before, I just thought we were just one big group, you go fight a war and I didn't know who did what but now, I see where we stand globally as far as, like, what branches do what service. Aircraft people, they stay pretty much on United States soil and then they send huge ships to do logistics. Marines, they're the ones who keep in really good shape so that they can go and get that first push when we start the war, when we start a battle. We have the Army people who like, provide support to the Marines and they fight themselves too, you know, but they're the ones like, shooting guns and stuff. So, like, you start to learn all of these things and later on, as a supervisor, you get more information about why we are doing things. So, for instance, why we're fighting in Iraq, why we are sending these planes over there and how the aircraft carrier can support them as opposed to like, when you're, you know, fresh on this ship, like, I don't know, I'm just here on this boat. I'm supposed to fix that pump, that's all I know. So, you get more knowledgeable about things the longer you've been in.","JobSpecific,Navy"
