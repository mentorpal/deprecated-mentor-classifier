I joined when I was 21 and I didn't really have that many skills available to me. I graduated high school and I wasn't the best high school grad, you know, many people in the military aren't and I tried college for a while and I was very, an on and off again student. I got a few Fs when I was there and because I was working two jobs at the time and you know, my days were pretty full. So, the military actually allowed me to have a semi-regular life, you know, like a semi-regular life. Because I was taking care myself, because I didn't have the support of my family, the military welcomed me with a job, a place to stay, some cash in my pocket, a skill set and that pretty much, once I got that grounding, then I was able to be very independent, very self sustaining for a long time. So, it's kind of, it took care of me in that way. So, do I love the military? You could say that I do. You know, it's the thing that allowed me to have a college education later on, it's the thing that allowed me to save up so much money and I think I'm doing pretty well for someone my age, so. As far as my job, my job as an Electrician's Mate, I didn't, it's not the job that I really wanted to do at the beginning. I wanted to learn languages and you know, travel the world a lot and I'm a nuclear technician. We weren't really allowed to do that because you're a nuke, you have to stay on the continental United States, So, I couldn't visit, I couldn't be stationed in Germany, I couldn't be stationed in France, which, you know, really, was irritating for me. And, I wasn't a very good engineer. I didn't have the engineering mindset when I joined the military at first. However, I grew to love my job because the training that they give you, they make you a real expert at it. So, once you find a job that you can do, you start doing well and then you start getting awards, you start learning more things on your own and eventually I said, ""You know what? Electrician's Mate is really cool. It's one of the best jobs that you can have in the military. So, I think it's, my love for the Navy comes from all of that combined.","JobSpecific, Motivation,Positive"

Of course the salary is no joke I make decent money, enough to live and enough to support myself, but the skills that they provide they really go pretty far. Whenever I mention the type of work that I do, people's eyes light up and it makes me really proud of being able to say that I work with nuclear technology. Other sources of pride come in the fact that it's not everybody that can actually push an aircraft carrier through the water and I can actually say that my hands touched something that made this huge multibillion dollar piece of equipment go through the water to fight a war. It was me. If I push it twisted this way it would've stopped or did it this way it goes fast. So that's a once in a lifetime experience and adventure.","Motivation,Positive"

At least in my work center of course I'm always going to be turning to the person right beside me, the senior chief or even the master chief of the command to kind of give me directions so that I can become a better chief myself. I expect them to tell me when I'm messing up. I expect them to kinda correct me in a lot of situations and to give me lots of advice. So, in my work center it's going to be the next person, next enlisted person in front of me. However, as an electrician I also have a lot of respect for the academic side of the science. So for instance when I read about things, read about nuclear technology things and the way they are improving from MIT or from Berkeley or from other places that, you know, promote nuclear technology then I'm really proud of them as well, and that's why I started becoming a university student myself because I want to follow in that direction. I see our tech, our engineering field has a lot of room to expand and I want to be a part of that. So I look to people promoting engineering marvels.","Miscellaneous, Motivation"

The first of which is you hear this very often, follow your passion. So personally my passion was music and art. I wasn't an engineer person per se, when I was a kid all the way up until a couple years after I joined the navy. That's right, I joined as an engineer and I wasn't an engineer until after I got to my first ship. I, to tell you the truth, I didn't even like it too much. I like talking languages, and you know conversing with people, and you know writing stuff, and typing on the computer. I did not want to see oil, I did not want to touch a wrench you know, that wasn't for me, but in the end, it brings me to my second point. Try to become really good at the skills that you possess. So for me, I think I'm a good electrician. I became a supervisor after some time, and it's not because I had a passion for electrician things, it's because I found that I was good at it, and that gave me motivation to learn more and more about it, and once I started doing that then it became easy for me. And after it becomes easy for you, then you can start explaining things really well, you can start reading a book and learning more about it really well, you start getting awards for it, you start you know wanting to know more about it. So yeah those two things: follow your passion and if that's not for you, then follow the skills that are provided to you.","Advice, Fit, Motivation"

Can you help?|What should I do if I don't know which job would suit me best?,"If you don't know what job you want to do, then my suggestion is that try to push yourself to try to do as hard a job as possible. You can always go down but in many cases it's very hard to go up. So for instance if you pick a simple job like let's say picking plants. I don't mean to discredit any plant pickers out there, but if your job is to pick plants, and then all of sudden you want to be a computer scientist, let's say, it might be hard to try to make that switch. You don't have the skills to do computer science, you don't have the background, you might not have the right way to think about the world. However, I think as a computer scientists, if I wanted to, I could be a very, very good plant picker, so you can always go down but it's hard to go up.","Advice, Fit, Motivation"

I grew up in the fifth sixth and seventh grade and part of the eighth grade in Germany, and although I didn't really see the military part of it, I did see some of the things that like you could have outside of the work. So I saw the nice house that you could live in, I saw the cool car that he was driving, I saw many times you know people PTing, exercising outside, PT is physical training. So I kind of got the impression of like what the military lifestyle would be like compared to all the civilian lifestyles that I saw back where I'm from, and I gotta say it was really impressive.","Motivation, Background, Military,Navy"

I did eight years in the navy as an active duty Electrician's Mate and I learned a lot about engineering, and I thought I was going to go to college to do electrical engineering. However, some of the classes that you learn with electrical engineering are computer science, and I went to a research internship. It wasn't an internship it was just research for UC Berkeley, and I thought I was going to do electrical engineering, but they had so many cool computer science topics and professors and little things around campus that really empowered me to kind of consider computer science as a career. So when I went back home, when I was done with the research and I went back home, I really focused on my computer science classes and I just realized, hey you know out of all the classes that I am learning, math, science, english, the computer science classes were some of the most fun, and I just thought you know, if I want to make my own business, if I was doing electrical engineering I'd have to go to radio shack, I'd have to buy resistors, I'd have to spend lots of money, I'd have to like spend lots of time. But with computer science, you have your own business right in front of you if you just open up your laptop. You can have a million dollar idea just opening your laptop and typing on some keys. So that sold me.","Motivation, Background, STEM"

So at the time I was just graduated from high school, I was working at McDonalds, and you know various odd jobs, Swap Meet, a movie theater, used to sell knives, used to sell home alarm systems, I was bouncing all over the place. And I kept coming back to the thinking you know what, the military is a good way to start. I knew about their money for education, I knew about, after you do your tour you could have a really good professional career outside of the military you know. So these things were in the back of my mind. Unfortunately, I tried to join in high school and my eyesight is really bad, so they had disqualified me from joining. So I spent two years outside of high school trying to you know make my way through community college, make my way through various odd jobs, and it just wasn't for me. So like the military was a good step to, I tried again and I was accepted. So that was really step to start me off on a good career.","Decisions, Background, Motivation,Navy"
clintanderson_A197_4_1,What problem are you looking to solve?,What are you trying to fix?|What problem are you solving?,"I'm trying to solve lots of different problems that are very educationally oriented. So, I want to bring technology to the classroom. I noticed that when I was in school, that the lectures were boring, from teachers, you know, writing up there on the blackboard, that the books, you know, they're kind of dry and you know, the words are plain. and then I go home and I see entertainment. I watch YouTube videos and I watch Netflix and I'm, you know, like, the videos that I watch are like, very educationally oriented. You know, I watch physics videos and I watch computer science videos so I try to, I would like to bring that style of education into the classroom because it's more interesting. So, I'm trying to solve that problem when it comes to things that I want to see come in the future.","Motivation, Impact"

You know, like, there's water that needs to be had in Africa or there's, I don't know, a building that needs to be built bigger or there needs to be like, a different type of game that I want to see in multi-person online role-playing games or something. So, lot of it comes from myself. Of course I can watch videos like YouTube or I can you know, hear people talking and then like, get inspirational from that but I think that the best types of ideas come from, you know, your own past, the things that you witnessed in your life and then you make new things, something that no one has ever thought of. Those are the best types of ideas that I think should be created.",Motivation

You already know where you want to go and it's just a matter of getting there as fast as possible. So, that's what I mean when I say flow, like, it's kind of like, if you play video games and you know how you're supposed to beat the boss and then you can see the person on the screen running and jumping and you know, sliding and stuff but you're not thinking about the way that your hands are controlling the character. You know, you're not thinking about B, B, up, down, left, right. You're just thinking of the person running and jumping and so, that's what homework is for me. That's what, like, when I do my start-up, that's what it is for me, you know, I see the end goal and that time, you know, between the time that where you are and the final product, that's the flow that I mean where it's like, you can just get into it and it's really fun and you can do it all day, because it's, you know, so inspirational.","Motivation, JobSpecific"

What is it that I'm supposed to be doing?"" and you think of a multi-level solution and you finally get the answer and you know, it's kind of like playing chess or something, you know, you get into this point where you can kind of see things, you know, like five six seven steps down the road and if you don't think of it that way, then you won't solve that problem.

Everybody has family back home, everybody wants to, you know, see the next day. So, I'm not a coward, you know, when it becomes time to go fight, then I will but it's not like I want to fight.

The people that I care about can be wounded, injured or the fact that I might have to go over there and you know, maybe put someone else in harm, you know, someone that I'm attacking or support someone who, you know,. attacks somebody.

When I was in school, you know, I had like math and science and physics and chemistry and nothing really like, pushed me to, you know, want to learn myself but computer science had something about it that is, there's a little bit of math but not too much to make me scared, there is a little bit of graphics to, you know, at least so I could see what it was that I was doing. You know, there was a little bit of like logic but not too difficult. Everything is in moderation and it's as hard as you make it.

So, eating is pretty high on the list. Because in Japan, they don't have all of the things that I'm used to in America, then I kind of, just kind of hang out by myself, go to bars, obviously talking with friends and I play video games a lot while I'm here.

If I have those people around me, then I call that successful. Right now, I think I'm successful. Now, many people also choose to say, ""Well, success depends on what you want to do in the future"" and for that one, I say, ""If you're doing all of the things that it takes to get you from point A to point B.

I have to say sometimes it is. There many times that we were asked to clean, and I hate cleaning. But at least for the aircraft carrier that I was on, you clean all the time, every single day, at least one hour. For some of the training that we do it's also boring. Especially the things that you don't know well, then it's just coming at you and your mind just kind of blanks out. For the things that you do know well, then you've heard it thousands and thousands of times, so you don't really pay attention to that either. It's the things in the middle, that you know fifty sixty percent of and you have that kind of interest in okay well what what is it that I'm missing? But those times are not all the time. So it can be boring, but I think whether stem careers are boring should be seen in the range of other jobs. So you can say is a McDonald's career boring? Well you're flipping burgers and maybe the first couple weeks it's interesting, I'm learning this, and I know how to push this button, but then after you do for a long time then it gets kind of repetitive.
