Infected people have had a wide range of symptoms reported – from mild symptoms to severe illness and death. The virus spreads easily through close contact: primarily respiratory droplets and airborne. Less commonly it can be spread through contact with contaminated surfaces. Symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure to the virus.
