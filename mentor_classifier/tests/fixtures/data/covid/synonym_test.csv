How do the vaccines work?,"In a two-dose vaccine, the first dose primes the immune system â€” prepares the body to respond appropriately to the second dose and form antibodies. That first dose helps ensure a robust immune response that will get coded into the memory cells in the body. These are the cells we will rely on when we see COVID-19 next time around. A single-dose vaccine is designed to trigger a sufficient immune response with one dose.", 0
Who should not get the vaccine?,"The following groups should delay receiving the COVID-19 vaccine at this time: Those allergic to specific ingredients in the vaccines (most notably polyethylene glycol); Those who have had acute COVID-19 infection in the last 90 days; Those who received monoclonal antibody for COVID-19 in the last 90 days; Those who have received any other vaccination in the last 14 days. People who have had past anaphylactic reactions to vaccines or injection medications should talk with their primary care physician before receiving the vaccination. If they choose to receive it, they will be monitored for 30 minutes after receipt.",0
will the vaccine make me test positive on covid tests?,"COVID-19 vaccines will not cause you to test positive on COVID-19 viral tests. The vaccines tell your body to make a harmless protein that will generate an immune response. The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are mRNA-based. The Johnson and Johnson/Janssen vaccine uses a different, harmless virus.",0
what is the immunity rate after taking a vaccine?,"The vaccines are effective approximately 2-4 weeks after their final dose, so 2-4 weeks after the Johnson & Johnson first dose or 2 weeks after the Pfizer or Morderna second dose (total of 5-6 weeks after the first dose). Clinical trials indicate the protection lasts for at least 3 months after the final dose. However, vaccines do not provide full immunity from possible COVID-19 infection or spreading the virus, so you should continue following [COVID-19 guidelines](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cloth-face-cover-guidance.html) such as masks and distancing.",0
