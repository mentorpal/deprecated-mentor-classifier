I'm worried that I have been exposed. What do I do?,"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defines the operational description of close contact as being within 6 feet of another person for a combined total of 15 minutes or longer within a 24-hour period. Brief interactions are less likely to result in transmission. However, symptoms and the type of interaction (e.g., if an infected person coughs directly into the face of the exposed individual) remain important in determining if an exposure occurred.  An exposure to an exposed person does not require self-isolation or additional steps. Contact the hotline at 213-740-6291 if you have additional questions.",0
What are the guidelines for wearing a mask after I have been vaccinated?,"People should still wear masks even after receiving the vaccine.
