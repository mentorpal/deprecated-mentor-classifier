"My name is EMC Clint Anderson, that's Electrician's Mate Clinton Anderson. I was born in Los Angeles, California. I was raised there most of my life and I graduated from high school there. A couple of years after graduating from high school, then I joined the United States Navy. I was an Electrician's Mate for eight years. I served on an aircraft carrier. We went on many deployments. A deployment is when you go to war, you fight. We fought in the Iraq war. I went on three deployments and it was a really great time in my life. I had a lot of fun. At the end of the eight years, I decided that the Navy wasn't quite a career for me. So, I got out of the Navy. I started using the education benefits that we received and I started going to the University of California at Berkeley. I was majoring in computer science and afterwards, I started getting my master's degree from the University of Southern California. I also had a job at the Institute for Creative Technologies. It's been a lot of fun, this whole time. Thanks to the Navy."
